# Enhanced Multi-GPU Implementation

## Key Improvements

1. **Forced Multi-GPU Usage for Large Models**: The system now always uses all available GPUs for large models (8B and 70B).

2. **Smarter Layer Distribution**: Transformer layers are now distributed evenly across devices based on available memory, rather than using a simple modulo approach.

3. **Retry Mechanism**: Added a retry mechanism that attempts to load the model multiple times with different strategies if memory errors occur.

4. **Aggressive KV Cache Sharding**: KV cache is now always sharded across all available devices on the KV heads dimension for more efficient memory usage.

5. **Fallback Strategies**: If a tensor cannot be placed on its assigned device due to memory constraints, the system will try alternative devices.

6. **Memory-Aware Tensor Placement**: Non-layer weights are distributed based on tensor size and available device memory.

7. **Detailed Memory Reporting**: Added more detailed memory reporting at DEBUG level 2 to help diagnose issues.

## How It Works

- The system detects all available GPUs and their memory capacity
- For 8B and 70B models, it forces the use of all available GPUs
- Transformer layers are distributed evenly across devices to balance memory usage
- KV cache is sharded across all devices for maximum memory efficiency
- If memory errors occur, the system will retry with different strategies
- The implementation gracefully falls back to simpler approaches if errors occur

## Usage

No changes are needed in how you use the system. It will automatically detect and use multiple GPUs when available, with a much more aggressive approach to distributing model parts across devices.
