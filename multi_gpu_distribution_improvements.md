# Multi-GPU Distribution Improvements

We've made several key improvements to ensure that model weights and computations are properly distributed across all available GPUs:

## 1. Enhanced Device Detection and Logging

- Added explicit device detection before building the model
- Increased logging verbosity to track which devices are being used
- Added verification steps to confirm multi-GPU usage is working

## 2. Improved Weight Distribution in `concat_weights`

- Added explicit round-robin distribution for non-layer weights
- Enhanced tracking of tensor placement across devices
- Added detailed memory usage reporting before and after distribution
- Implemented more aggressive fallback strategies when tensor placement fails

## 3. Better KV Cache Distribution

- Added verification of KV cache sharding across devices
- Improved logging to track which devices are being used for the KV cache
- Added multiple sharding strategies with better fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced error handling to ensure KV cache is always distributed

## 4. More Aggressive Memory Management

- Fixed the `force_memory_cleanup` function to properly synchronize CUDA devices
- Added multiple approaches to clear GPU memory between operations
- Implemented more frequent memory cleanup at critical points

## 5. Explicit Multi-GPU Mode

- Added a `multi_gpu` flag to explicitly track when we're using multiple GPUs
- Modified the model building process to be more aware of multi-GPU usage
- Added verification steps to confirm model layers are distributed across devices

## Debugging and Verification

To verify that the model is properly distributed across GPUs, we've added several debugging outputs:

1. **Weight Distribution**: After loading weights, we now print how many tensors are on each device
2. **Layer Verification**: We check which device each layer's weights are on
3. **KV Cache Distribution**: We verify how the KV cache is distributed across devices
4. **Memory Usage Tracking**: We track memory usage on each GPU throughout the process

## Usage

To get the most detailed information about multi-GPU distribution, set `DEBUG=1` or `DEBUG=2` in your environment. This will show:

- Which devices are detected
- How weights are distributed across devices
- How the KV cache is distributed
- Memory usage on each device throughout the process

These improvements should ensure that your model is properly distributed across all available GPUs, making efficient use of your hardware resources.
