Multi-GPU Support Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. Modified build_transformer in inference.py to detect and use multiple GPUs
2. Updated concat_weights in tinygrad_helpers.py to intelligently distribute weights across GPUs
3. Added utility functions for GPU memory management
4. Enhanced KV cache creation to use multiple GPUs efficiently
5. Updated ensure_shard method to automatically detect and use multiple GPUs for large models

## How It Works

- The system now automatically detects available GPUs
- For large models (70B or 8B with many layers), it distributes model parts across GPUs
- Weights are distributed based on layer number and available GPU memory
- KV cache is sharded across GPUs to maximize memory efficiency
- The implementation gracefully falls back to single-GPU mode if needed

## Usage

No changes are needed in how you use the system. It will automatically detect and use multiple GPUs when available and when the model is large enough to benefit from it.
