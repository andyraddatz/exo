# Enhanced Multi-GPU Implementation for Large Models

## Key Improvements

1. **Aggressive Large Tensor Handling**
   - Large tensors (>500MB) are now identified and pre-assigned to GPUs with the most available memory
   - Tensors are tracked and memory usage is updated after each placement to ensure balanced distribution

2. **Memory-Aware Fallback Strategies**
   - If a tensor cannot be placed on its assigned device, the system tries alternative devices in order of available memory
   - As a last resort, tensors can be sharded across all devices when no single device has enough memory

3. **Optimized KV Cache Management**
   - Multiple sharding strategies are attempted for KV cache (KV heads, context, K/V dimension, batch)
   - For very large models, KV cache starts with a reduced context size to save memory
   - Fallback to CPU placement if GPU memory is exhausted

4. **Enhanced Memory Management**
   - Added `force_memory_cleanup()` utility to aggressively clean memory between operations
   - Added `print_gpu_memory_usage()` utility for detailed memory diagnostics
   - Implemented garbage collection at critical points in the loading process

5. **Incremental Weight Loading**
   - For consolidated weight files, weights can be loaded one file at a time with memory cleanup between loads
   - This prevents memory spikes during the loading process

6. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Multiple retry attempts with different strategies when memory errors occur
   - Detailed logging of memory usage before and after operations to help diagnose issues
   - Graceful degradation when memory constraints are encountered

7. **Automatic Multi-GPU Detection**
   - System automatically detects all available GPUs and their memory capacity
   - Forces multi-GPU usage for large models (3B, 8B, and 70B)
   - Provides detailed memory usage information for debugging

## How It Works

The enhanced implementation follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**
   - Clean up memory and detect available GPUs
   - Print initial memory usage for diagnostics
   - Force multi-GPU usage for large models

2. **Weight Loading**
   - Try to load weights with standard approach
   - If memory error occurs, fall back to incremental loading
   - Track memory usage throughout the process

3. **Tensor Distribution**
   - Identify large tensors and pre-assign them to devices with most memory
   - Group model weights by layer and distribute layers evenly across devices
   - Update memory tracking after each tensor placement
   - Try alternative devices if primary assignment fails

4. **KV Cache Creation**
   - Start with reduced context size for large models
   - Try multiple sharding strategies in order of preference
   - Fall back to CPU if necessary

5. **Error Recovery**
   - Multiple retry attempts with different strategies
   - Aggressive memory cleanup between attempts
   - Detailed logging to help diagnose issues

## Usage

No changes are needed in how you use the system - it will automatically detect and use multiple GPUs when available, with a much more aggressive approach to distributing model parts across devices.

The system is designed to make the best use of your available GPU memory, automatically adjusting strategies based on the model size and available resources.

## Debugging

Set the `DEBUG` level to 1 or 2 for detailed memory usage information:
- Level 1: Basic memory usage information and error messages
- Level 2: Detailed memory usage, tensor placement decisions, and sharding strategies

This information can help diagnose memory issues and optimize the distribution of model parts across GPUs.
